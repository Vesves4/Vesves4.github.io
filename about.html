                    <h2>My DevOps Journey: From Chaos to Mastery</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Before stepping into the world of DevOps, I spent my time experimenting with software development—building game launchers, updaters, and even injectors in C# to break games for fun. I was always drawn to problem-solving, but I had no idea that my curiosity would eventually lead me to a full-fledged career.</br>
                Then, in 2022, an old friend reached out with a job offer. He called it "DevOps." I had never even heard of the term before, but based on what I knew about programming and infrastructure, it didn’t seem too daunting. The promise of learning on the job was exciting, so I thought, why not? And just like that, I dove in headfirst.

                <h4>Baptism by Fire</h4>
                The moment I started, I was thrown straight into the deep end. "Don't worry, it's only a mid-level position. It won't be that hard," they said. Famous last words.
                Suddenly, I was juggling an overwhelming number of tasks—containerizing applications, updating security certificates, troubleshooting website outages, and even spinning up new clusters on demand. It was chaos. But amidst the stress, I discovered something unexpected: I loved it. The thrill of being thrown into the unknown, figuring things out on the fly, and somehow making everything work was exhilarating.</br>
                While handling my daily tasks, I was also immersing myself in internal projects, learning everything I could. The first couple of months were brutal, but I slowly began to grasp the patterns. Every challenge was just a puzzle waiting to be solved, every failure a lesson in disguise. Concepts that once felt foreign—like caching mechanisms, Helm charts, and CI/CD pipelines—became second nature.</br> </br>

                <h4>Growing Pains and Breakthroughs</h4>
                Half a year into my journey, my struggles shifted from "I have no idea what I'm doing" to "Why isn't this working when everything is set up perfectly?!" (Spoiler: It was never perfect—usually a missing flag or a simple typo). But this frustration was different—it meant I was growing.
                By this time, I was handling bigger tasks, like setting up GitLab and Nexus container registries from scratch. It was a nightmare. Everything looked fine, yet nothing worked. After countless hours of debugging, I finally got it running… only for us to remove one of them later. But hey, at least one survived.</br> </br>

                <h4>Leveling Up: Entering the Enterprise World</h4>
                A year passed, and my projects wrapped up. I faced a choice: wait for something familiar or take on a new challenge with new technologies. The answer was obvious.
                "How hard can it be?" I thought. <h5>Enter: Microsoft Azure.</h5>
                Azure was a beast. At first, I hated every second of it. It was structured, logical, and functional—but only if you 100% knew what you were doing. Otherwise, you were doomed. Managing Azure DevOps repos, setting up pipelines for Databricks ETL workflows, and refactoring bloated Terraform scripts was a trial by fire. I had to build entire environments from Development to Production, configuring virtual machines, networking, and security policies. It was a huge learning experience, and in the end, we made it work.
                Unfortunately, my contract ended just as the project launched. I never got to see the full impact of what we built, but I still keep in touch with the team, watching as my work continues to evolve.</br> </br>

                <h4>The Big Leagues: Scaling Up</h4>
                My next challenge was a mid-senior DevOps role on a massive-scale enterprise project—a GitHub Server with 1,100 repositories and over 1,000 developers. We were a team of just four DevOps engineers.
                Everything had to be precise. Every change had to be reviewed, approved, and communicated. If something went down, it had to be back up within minutes. There was no room for solo decisions or improvisation—only team-approved, bulletproof solutions. This was a whole new level of professional rigor. The stakes were high, but so was the satisfaction of keeping such a vast infrastructure running smoothly.</br> </br>

                <h4>Looking Forward: The Next Chapter</h4>
                When that project ended, I made a tough decision: leave my company and aim higher. The company I worked for was small, and while the experience was invaluable, the ceiling was low. I wanted more—bigger projects, greater impact, and the chance to own the solutions I built.
                Had I been working for the contracting company directly, I would have stayed to push my projects further, see them grow, and truly leave my mark. Instead, I was left with just dates and responsibilities on my résumé—without the ability to even name my biggest projects due to NDAs.
                But that's just the beginning. <h5>Now, I'm looking ahead—ready for the next challenge.</h5></p>
