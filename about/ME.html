                    <h3>Grafana, Loki and Node exporter</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Monitoring isn't just a checkbox; it's critical for maintaining system health. Grafana is my go-to for dashboards, paired with Loki for logs, Promtail for log shipping, and Node Exporter for system metrics. I've set up and managed full Grafana stacks as both containers and services. Setup is usually smooth—until enterprise firewall rules or UFW restrictions throw a wrench in the works.</br></br>
                One of my biggest projects involved monitoring 30+ VMs, tracking storage, network usage, and even /tmp space (a must for Jenkins masters). Dashboards are easy to configure; it's all about what needs monitoring and how the client wants the data displayed. Deployment depends on the environment, but there's always a way to make it work.

                <header class="major">
                    <h3>Zabbix</h3>
                </header>
                <p>I first used this tool in my initial project. Since it was a small company with minimal monitoring needs, they weren't looking to invest heavily, so Zabbix was our middle-ground solution. While the tool itself wasn't difficult to use, the documentation was tricky to navigate, and the Web UI felt unintuitive at first. However, its flexibility—allowing custom shell commands and scripts for data queries directly on the agent host—made it a solid choice. For smaller projects with just a few monitoring sources (2-3 max), I'd recommend it. It's lightweight, and with a bit of reading, you can have it up and running in a day or two.</p>
