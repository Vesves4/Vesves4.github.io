                <p><h4>Keycloak</h4>
                Keycloak has been my go-to identity and access management (IAM) solution for securing applications. I've set up SSO (Single Sign-On), OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and LDAP integrations, managed user roles, and configured realm settings for multi-tenant applications. I've also used it to secure APIs and internal services, ensuring only authorized users could access them.</br></br>
                <h4>OpenSSL</h4>
                OpenSSL is essential for handling SSL/TLS certificates. I've used it to generate self-signed certificates, create CSRs (Certificate Signing Requests), and manage private keys. It's also come in handy for certificate conversions, encryption, and verifying certificates when dealing with secure connections in various projects.</br></br>
                <h4>OpenSSH</h4>
                A must-have for remote access and automation. I've set up SSH key authentication, managed bastion hosts, and configured SSH tunneling for secure access to restricted services. I've also worked with automated SSH scripts for deployments and infrastructure management.</br></br>
                <h4>Linux UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)</h4>
                Security is always a priority, and I've configured UFW rules to control access to services running on Linux servers. From allowing/restricting ports to blocking unwanted traffic, I've used UFW to ensure secure network communication between applications, whether on bare metal, VMs, or containers.</br></br>
                <h4>Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)</h4>
                Azure RBAC is key for managing permissions and access control in cloud environments. I've assigned roles, created custom roles, and set up least-privilege access for various Azure services like VMs, Key Vault, Storage Accounts, and Databricks. Ensuring users and services have only the necessary permissions is critical for security, and I've had hands-on experience enforcing these policies.</br></br>

                Each of these tools plays a vital role in security, authentication, and access control, and I've worked with them extensively to secure infrastructure and applications.</p>
